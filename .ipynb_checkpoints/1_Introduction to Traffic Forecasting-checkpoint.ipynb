    "The traffic forecasting problem introduced in this tutorial is refering to short-term traffic state forecating. Short-term traffic states can be influenced by many factors, and thus, short-term traffic states is highly stochastic. However, from a long-term perspective, traffic patterns have strong periodicity. For example, the traffic states has strong daily, weekly, or even monthly patterns. Thus, the temporal information ($T$) is an important factor that influnces future traffic states. Exsiting works have attempted to incorporate temporal information, such as $T$, into a traffic prediction model, and the corresponding traffic forecasting problem can be formulated as fitting a function $F$ such that\n",

    "If a traffic influential factor has spatiotemporal properties, the factors can be considered as features of the input. If the values of a factor are continuous, the values at time $t$ can be easily concatenated to input vector $x_t$. If the values of a factor are discrete, we can also convert the factor as one-hot vector and attach it to $x_t$. There are also other methods to input extra features into a model, such as designing a sub-network."
